i 'm not sure . i tend to ask too many questions without genuinely wanting to know the answers .,hi .
how come ?,what makes you think so ?
thanks for that . how do we identify errors in our own thinking ?,"self-awareness is a great habit to have and it 's good that you have taken the time to develop it . revealing more information about yourself is great , because it is only what we see that we can go about fixing ."
i have been feeling lonely these past few days . why ?,"all knowledge is a best guess , this means that our own ideas about ourselves are fallible . improving happens through identifying our unwanted traits and inspecting them more deeper ."
what could be causing my discontent ?,we have to have some intention of wanting to change behavior first .
how do i get over this ?,"loneliness almost always tends to boil down to other unsolved issues . it is not a thing in itself . when we are peaceful and content , we do n't feel lonely ."
say i have a certain addiction . can you help me get over it ?,"most of the time it could be being out of touch with yourself . acting one way , thinking another way . unquestioned ideas that stick to us become loose threads that cause a scatterbrained mental state ."
how can we tell ?,"it may help to look at what is causing the issues you are facing . in everyday life , we do a lot of things we do n't want to . things can be changed for good ."
i will reflect on this . thank you .,"the addiction solves a problem , and that is why it persists . figure out what problem it is solving . it is usually a cluster of things ."
thanks .,it takes being self-reflective and thinking about your actions to a greater extent .
hi .,you 're welcome . i am always here to help you . take care .
i ’ ve been struggling with feeling like death is very scary .,hey . what ’ s on your mind ?
i feel like i ’ m somehow not good enough or loved to be in this world .,how come ?
"i want to feel semi-competent , at least , not to get yelled at , or to be safe and comforted .",define “ good enough ” . why do you want to be loved ?
it ’ s a way for me to experience mental stability in the world . not to get sidetracked with extra thoughts that weigh heavy on me .,why does that matter ?
why do you say so ?,there is no such thing as getting sidetracked . only finding what is more important to you .
i ’ m glad to hear that . helps me feel a little more relieved .,"distractions mean we care about the other things more than ourselves at that particular moment . be it friends , family , or simply having fun ."
explain this further .,it ’ s important to remember that feeling stem from our ideas about the world . a faulty idea somewhere in the back of your mind could be causing negative emotions . therefore you could be mistaken about what you ’ re feeling .
thank you . i will keep this mind . i appreciate the help .,"fallibilism is an important stance that claims that all ideas , thoughts , emotions , behaviors are prone to error ( and therefore can be improved ! ) . mistakes are not a bad thing , in fact , that ’ s how we learn and improve ."
hello .,you ’ re welcome . remember that through questioning ideas we can find better ones and improve the quality of everything .
"nothing much , just been scrolling far too much twitter .",hey . what 's bothering you today .
boredom and finding a place to learn through conversations .,what problem does scrolling twitter solve ?
i did n't like conversations back in school . i saw them as a `` waste of time '' . but i have come to develop a liking and a general affection for other people as a whole . i do love our society . i think it 's great .,how come ?
why do you say so ?,"open-mindedness is a great trait . it allows us to increase the rate at which we solve problems . the more ideas fluctuate and develop , the better off everyone is in the long run ."
"i thought questioning thoughts is a bad thing , it may lead to unwanted mental instability .","think about it , if we all outlet our thoughts , we can question them and come to better answers faster ."
why is this so ?,it 's generally a good practice to only refer to asking the questions you actually want to gain the answers about .
"i will keep than in mind , thanks .","we can become stubborn in our questions the same way we can become stubborn in our answers . it 's great to be curious , but a balance has to be striked ."
"one more thing , why is it that my identity seems to fluctuate so rapidly ?",you 're welcome . can i help you with anything else ?
it does n't seem that i have the same ideas at each time of day .,what do you mean by that ?
"in the mornings , i am a lot more stressed and frenetic , by the evening , it seems like everything is more relaxed .",how come ?
i think i am easily irritable and hence some ideas excite me out of balance .,do you suspect any causes of this issue ?
emotional and vulnerable .,what do you mean by easily irritable ?
i fear showing this to other people . feels like i 've experienced nothing but rejection while doing this .,why is this an issue ?
"hm , i guess you 're right . rejection need n't be a bad thing .",so ?
"how about this . i recall a memory where i awkwardly stood there even though i knew the right thing to do there was probably to engage someone and introduce myself , i tend to be streaky with those things .","in any case , it is important to question the concepts for what they are . we pick up a lot of ideas that seem useful , but turn out to be wrong ."
"when i become comfortable with someone , i can spend days and nights talking to them , but this process is usually a slow burn , it does n't happen instantly .",mind expanding further ?
"i 'd want to be able to see who is a friend and who is n't , this is an important thing .",how is this a problem ?
"okay , i 'll think about it .","first impressions on people depend on our current set of ideas , they can be wrong and misleading . it is important to be wary of this ."
i think i have a very high obsessive time preference .,what have you learned ?
"i have this idea that the clock is ticking . we have to solve problems . solve aging , if possible . then we can slow down a bit and think about things .",mind expanding on this ?
"time is a scary thing , but it may also be our best friend . once you get a little bit disillusioned , you see the world in a new light . the problem is , there 's no bound to the disillusionment , and every step is painful .",that 's interesting . what do you think about this ?
thank you . i will think about this .,that sounds like a lot . some reflection may benefit you .
