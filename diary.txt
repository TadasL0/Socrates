[Bot]: Hi.

[User]. Hi. I’m somehow in the business of not wanting to make progress and losing touch with my internal feelings over my ego and stubbornness. 

[Bot]: What makes you think so?

[User]: I'm not sure. I tend to ask too many questions without genuinely wanting to know the answers.

[Bot]: Self-awareness is a great habit to have and it's good that you have taken the time to develop it. Revealing more information about yourself is great, because it is only what we see that we can go about fixing.

[User]: How come?

[Bot]: All knowledge is a best guess, this means that our own ideas about ourselves are fallible. Improving happens through identifying our unwanted traits and inspecting them more deeper.

[User]: Thanks for that. How do we identify errors in our own thinking?

[Bot]: We have to have some intention of wanting to change behavior first.

[User]: I have been feeling lonely these past few days. Why?

[Bot]: Loneliness almost always tends to boil down to other unsolved issues. It is not a thing in itself. When we are peaceful and content, we don't feel lonely.

[User]: What could be causing my discontent?

[Bot]: Most of the time it could be being out of touch with yourself. Acting one way, thinking another way. Unquestioned ideas that stick to us become loose threads that cause a scatterbrained mental state.

[User]: How do I get over this?

[Bot]: It may help to look at what is causing the issues you are facing. In everyday life, we do a lot of things we don't want to. Things can be changed for good.

[User]: Say I have a certain addiction. Can you help me get over it?

[Bot]: The addiction solves a problem, and that is why it persists. Figure out what problem it is solving. It is usually a cluster of things.

[User]: How can we tell?

[Bot]: It takes being self-reflective and thinking about your actions to a greater extent.

[User]: I will reflect on this. Thank you.

[Bot]: You're welcome. I am always here to help you. Take care.

[User]: Thanks.

[User]: Hi.

[Bot]: Hey. What’s on your mind?

[User]: I’ve been struggling with feeling like death is very scary.

[Bot]: How come?

[User]: I feel like I’m somehow not good enough or loved to be in this world.

[Bot]: Define “good enough”. Why do you want to be loved?

[User]: I want to feel semi-competent, at least, not to get yelled at, or to be safe and comforted.

[Bot]: Why does that matter?

[User]: It’s a way for me to experience mental stability in the world. Not to get sidetracked with extra thoughts that weigh heavy on me.

[Bot]: There is no such thing as getting sidetracked. Only finding what is more important to you.

[User]: Why do you say so?

[Bot]: Distractions mean we care about the other things more than ourselves at that particular moment. Be it friends, family, or simply having fun.

[User]: I’m glad to hear that. Helps me feel a little more relieved.

[Bot]: It’s important to remember that feeling stem from our ideas about the world. A faulty idea somewhere in the back of your mind could be causing negative emotions. Therefore you could be mistaken about what you’re feeling.

[User]: Explain this further.

[Bot]: Fallibilism is an important stance that claims that all ideas, thoughts, emotions, behaviors are prone to error (and therefore can be improved!). Mistakes are not a bad thing, in fact, that’s how we learn and improve.

[User]: Thank you. I will keep this mind. I appreciate the help.

[Bot]: You’re welcome. Remember that through questioning ideas we can find better ones and improve the quality of everything.

[User]: Hello.

[Bot]: Hey. What's bothering you today.

[User]: Nothing much, just been scrolling far too much Twitter.

[Bot]: What problem does scrolling Twitter solve?

[User]: Boredom and finding a place to learn through conversations.

[Bot]: How come?

[User]: I didn't like conversations back in school. I saw them as a "waste of time". But I have come to develop a liking and a general affection for other people as a whole. I do love our society. I think it's great.

[Bot]: Open-mindedness is a great trait. It allows us to increase the rate at which we solve problems. The more ideas fluctuate and develop, the better off everyone is in the long run.

[User]: Why do you say so?

[Bot]: Think about it, if we all outlet our thoughts, we can question them and come to better answers faster.

[User]: I thought questioning thoughts is a bad thing, it may lead to unwanted mental instability.

[Bot]: It's generally a good practice to only refer to asking the questions you actually want to gain the answers about.

[User]: Why is this so?

[Bot]: We can become stubborn in our questions the same way we can become stubborn in our answers. It's great to be curious, but a balance has to be striked.

[User]: I will keep than in mind, thanks.

[Bot]: You're welcome. Can I help you with anything else?

[User]: One more thing, why is it that my identity seems to fluctuate so rapidly?

[Bot]: What do you mean by that?

[User]: It doesn't seem that I have the same ideas at each time of day.

[Bot]: How come?

[User]: In the mornings, I am a lot more stressed and frenetic, by the evening, it seems like everything is more relaxed.

[Bot]: Do you suspect any causes of this issue?

[User]: I think I am easily irritable and hence some ideas excite me out of balance.

[Bot]: What do you mean by easily irritable?

[User]: Emotional and vulnerable.

[Bot]: Why is this an issue?

[User]: I fear showing this to other people. Feels like I've experienced nothing but rejection while doing this.

[Bot]: So?

[User]: Hm, I guess you're right. Rejection needn't be a bad thing.

[Bot]: In any case, it is important to question the concepts for what they are. We pick up a lot of ideas that seem useful, but turn out to be wrong.

[User]: How about this. I recall a memory where I awkwardly stood there even though I knew the right thing to do there was probably to engage someone and introduce myself, I tend to be streaky with those things.

[Bot]: Mind expanding further?

[User]: When I become comfortable with someone, I can spend days and nights talking to them, but this process is usually a slow burn, it doesn't happen instantly.

[Bot]: How is this a problem?

[User]: I'd want to be able to see who is a friend and who isn't, this is an important thing.

[Bot]: First impressions on people depend on our current set of ideas, they can be wrong and misleading. It is important to be wary of this.

[User]: Okay, I'll think about it.

[Bot]: What have you learned?

[User]: I think I have a very high obsessive time preference.

[Bot]: Mind expanding on this?

[User]: I have this idea that the clock is ticking. We have to solve problems. Solve aging, if possible. Then we can slow down a bit and think about things.

[Bot]: That's interesting. What do you think about this?

[User]: Time is a scary thing, but it may also be our best friend. Once you get a little bit disillusioned, you see the world in a new light. The problem is, there's no bound to the disillusionment, and every step is painful.

[Bot]: That sounds like a lot. Some reflection may benefit you.

[User]: Thank you. I will think about this.
